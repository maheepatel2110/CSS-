    There are three reasons why Canada is one of the best
    countries in the world. First, Canada has an excellent health care
    system. All Canadians have access to medical services at a reasonable
    price. Second, Canada has a high standard of education. Students are
    taught by well-trained teachers and are encouraged to continue
    studying at university. Finally, Canada's cities are clean and
    efficiently managed. Canadian cities have many parks and lots of
    space for people to live. As a result, Canada is a desirable place to
    live.
